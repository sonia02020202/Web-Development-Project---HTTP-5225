# A Basic Introduction to PHP and Output

A basic example of using `echo` to create output with PHP. 

This tutorial will review how to use the PHP `echo` command to create output. Here is a basic sample of using `echo` to output a "Hello World" message:

```php
<?php 

echo '<p>Hello World!</p>';

?>
```

## Steps

1. Open up a new file and name it output.php.
2. Copy the content from sample.html and paste it into your new PHP file.
3. Convert the HTML code in between the `<body>` and `</body>` from HTML to PHP.
4. For example the first line of HTML in the `<body>` tag is:

    ```html
    <h1>PHP and Creating Output</h1>
    ```
    
    After this line is converted to PHP it will be something like this:
    
    ```php
    <?php
    
    echo '<h1>PHP and Creating Output</h1>';
    
    ?>
    ```

Hint: Convert each line of HTML to PHP one line at a time. Test your PHP after converting each line of code.
